# Minimum Spanning Tree
Algorithmic implementation to find Minimum Spanning Tree

__Spanning tree__ `H` is an acyclic graph whose length of `V(H) = V(G)` and `E(H)` is subset of `E(G)`. `G` is any given graph.

Now if we assign weights (certain integer) to edges of graph `G` then `G` becomes a weighted graph. This opens to certain problems or ideas to find __`minimum cost spanning tree`__ of graph `G`.
